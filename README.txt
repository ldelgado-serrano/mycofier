1th January 2016
ITS1 classificator of fungal sequences

USAGE:
perl MycofierClassificator.pl -infile <fasta file> -outfile <output classification> -numthreads <number of concurrent processes>

DISCLAIMER:
You will find a JAVA and a PERL implementation of Mycofier.
Unfortunately the JAVA implementation is too slow to be useful, we recommend the PERL implementation of it.
